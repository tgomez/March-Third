3 observations regarding PySchool Data

1)There is a positive correlation between school budget and score
2)Smaller school sizes tended to have higher scores
3)Students attending charter schools obtained higher scores. (assuming the NaN values in the "School Summary" section are Charter schools because my homework is a mess.)
